1. Calculate the P Value for the test in Problem 2.

The p-value for this test is the probability of obtaining a z-score equal to observed test statistic (which had z-score = -1.680919) or more extreme, which in this problem statement is less than the observed test statistic. In other words, we want to know the area under a standard normal curve on the interval (-8, -1.680919]. We can get this easily with 

pnorm(-1.680919)

# 0.04638932

> prop.test(1755, 1755 + 2771, p = 0.4, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.99, correct = FALSE)

# Result
 
1-sample proportions test without continuity correction

data:  1755 out of 1755 + 2771, null probability 0.4
X-squared = 2.8255, df = 1, p-value = 0.04639
alternative hypothesis: true p is less than 0.4
99 percent confidence interval:
 0.0000000 0.4047326
sample estimates:
        p 
0.3877596 


# Hypothesis test plot based on normal and t.dist from HH package

library(IPSUR) 
library(HH)
temp <- prop.test(1755, 1755 + 2771, p = 0.4, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.99, correct = FALSE) 
plot(temp, "Hypoth")


2. How do you test the proportions and compare against hypothetical props? Test Hypothesis: proportion of automatic cars is 40%.

# Null Hypothesis : Proportion of automatic cars is 40%.

> View(mtcars)
> table(mtcars$am)

19 13

> prop.test(13, 32, p = 0.4, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.95, correct = FALSE)

# Result

1-sample proportions test without continuity correction

data:  13 out of 32, null probability 0.4
X-squared = 0.0052083, df = 1, p-value = 0.5288
alternative hypothesis: true p is less than 0.4
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.0000000 0.5508812
sample estimates:
      p 
0.40625

# At confidence level of 0.95, since p- value is greater than alpha(0.53 > 0.05), hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis
